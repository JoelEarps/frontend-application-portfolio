The purpose of this repo is to provide an example of Frontend development of an application that will be public facing. It will provide others to view a wide range of skills needed for a FE web architectures.

The application will posses:

1. A landing page with a large amount, and variety, of content - demonstrating knowledge of rendering optimisation.
2. A "data heavy page" - where large amounts of data is fetched - demonstrating best practices for data fetching and server/ client side storage.
3. User based access and authentication.
4. Features that demonstrate server vs client side functionality.

Will be built in NextJS, hosted via vercel. The reason for this is:

1. NextJS implements a lot of features that otherwise would need implementing via React.
2. Vercel is free and optimised for NextJS.
