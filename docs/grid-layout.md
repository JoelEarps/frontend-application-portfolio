All documents start with `<!DOCTYPE hmtl>`
The html part has the html tag and then the visible part is in the body.
A divison i.e section of the html diagram can be defined by a div element.

### Grid View in HTML

When defining a grid view you can use the grid display style. From here you can then define how you want the grids to work.
This can be done by defining grid container rows properties.
This can be done with fractions etc or pixels - to make the fraction use easier you can use the repeat function to specify 6 colums each taking up a fraction - repeat(6, 1fr)
