From this session - things to learn would be

## Web Architectures

The architecture of the application and tis purpose will dictate the functionality you require for your web app.

SaaS - software as a service
Internal Application
Public Facing

This will dictate whether you need rendering performance or not, functional testing or maximum information displayed depending on who the end user is.

## General Notes

### Responsiveness

Cannot be measured as such however you can look at different screen resolutions, browsers and devices and test. Take all perspectives of how the application can be accessed.

Responsive (RWD) vs adaptive AWD vs fluid design (FWD):

1. RWD - Media queries that target breakpoints that scale images, wrap text etc to shrink fit size of screen.
2. AWD - Use CSS queries to optimise design for width of devices screen.
3. FWD - based on percentage of dimensions.

### Performance

Can be measured - for example lighthouse - integrated into chrome.
two main bench marks:

1. Time ot first meaningful paint
2. Time to interactive
